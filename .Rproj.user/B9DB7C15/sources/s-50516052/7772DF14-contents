### Getting Started with Linux

We are using the Linux command line to run most of the tools we use today. If you are new to Linux please complete the Intro to Command Line [Workshop](http://bifx-core.bio.ed.ac.uk/hyweldd/training/Bioinformatics_on_the_Command_Line/).

<br>

### Logging in
We have several servers that you can login to. For the purpose of this practical we will use bifx-rta. No matter where you login, you will have access to the same files and programs. bifx-core2 is also available if you use a VPN.

There are several options to login to our machines. You can use the **Terminal** app on a Mac or equivalant **Command Prompt** or MobaXTerm on Windows. Login via **X2G0** if you want a graphical interface. 

To login via command line: 
ssh USER@bifx-rta.bio.ed.ac.uk

Login with your user credentials for our servers (not the same as EASE)

If you are using MobaXTerm, an alternative way of logging in to the server is shown in the MobaXTerm demo.

Once you have typed in your password, you should see some welcome text and a prompt that looks something like this:

[USERNAME]@bifx-rta:~$

<!--Alternatively you can use **RStudio** which is an environment built for R programming but also gives you access to the command line terminal, your file structure and several other graphical features. 

1. Open this link in a new window: [bifx-rta.bio.ed.ac.uk](http://bifx-rta.bio.ed.ac.uk:8787)
2. Login with your user credentials for our servers (not the same as EASE)
3. Familiarise yourself with the different panels and locate the Terminal. -->

### 1. Creating A Web Directory 

In order to view files created on the server, we need to create a public_html directory.

After logging in you should be in your $HOME directory, check with;
```bash
pwd
```
This should show the PATH of your present working directory, which should now be your home directory as you have just logged in. You can return to this place at any time using the change directory command. 

```bash
cd
```
You have permissions to create files and directories under your home folder. Lets create some now which we will use later on. 

```bash
mkdir ~/public_html
mkdir ~/public_html/TMP
```

Here we have used the absolute path name for each directory using ~/ as a shortcut for your $HOME directory. Nested directories are separated by the forward slash '/' sign. 

As you have created  ~/public_html, contents of this directory are available online with any web browser 

To see it enter the following URL, changing yourUserName to what ever your username is. 

http://bifx-core.bio.ed.ac.uk/~yourUserName

### 2. Calibrated ChIP-seq sequencing data

The datasets used in this exercise are derived from a paired end ChIP-seq experiment using *S.cerevisiae* with *S.pombe* calibration.

<!--There are 2 biological replicates (though we recommend using 3 or more!) Reb1_R1 and Reb1_R2 as well as their corresponding input controls Input_R1 and Input_R2. For this experiment immunoprecipitation was performed with antibodies against Reb1. For the purpose of this workshop we have randomly subsampled and filtered out poor quality reads to speed up  -->

| Dataset | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| WT_IP_R1 | ChIP experiment, replicate 1 | Read 1 | 
| WT_IP_R2 | ChIP experiment, replicate 1 | Read 2 |
| WT_Input_R1 | Input DNA, replicate 1 | Read 1 | 
| WT_Input_R2 | Input DNA, replicate 1 | Read 2 |

### Obtaining data

First, make a new directory for this tutorial and move into that directory. Then link the directory to your public html folder as we are going to make everything public in this tutorial.

```bash
cd 
mkdir Calibration_workshop
cd Calibration_workshop
ln -s $PWD ~/public_html/
```
Next, create a subfolder called **fastq** for all of our sequence files and link the raw datasets to this folder:

<!-- 
/storage/marstonminiseq/marstonminiseq
/storage/marstonminiseq/marstonminiseq_datastore
create directory somewhere?
-->

```bash
mkdir fastq
ln -s /homes/library/training/calibration_workshop/data/*.fastq.gz fastq 
```

When you receive data from a sequencing centre the file should also be provided with an alphanumeric string known as an **md5 checksum**. We can think of this as a files passport or fingerprint and use it to verify our data and ensure it wasn't corrupted or truncated during download. The md5 checksums for these files are below. Lets check that now using the `md5sum` command:

|md5 checksum|filename|
|------------|--------|
|59718c6487dd85d134db274af8e36384|WT_IP_R1.fastq.gz|
|5d0f195a98569638c952e80f6311fbd0|WT_IP_R2.fastq.gz|
|16ad765d75edd5c0fd4cae41051ae316|WT_Input_R1.fastq.gz|
|6161aa4e69a457f5ff8e7b73e3676812|WT_Input_R2.fastq.gz|

```bash
cd fastq #Move into the fastq directory
md5sum *.fastq.gz > md5
cat md5 #prints out the contents of md5
#To check the files and md5 sums match at any time
md5sum -c md5 
```
